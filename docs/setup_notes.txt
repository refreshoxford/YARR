Some setup notes
----------------

WE MOVED FROM MONGO TO MYSQL. ORM methods didn't seem to work too well.

* install composer
$ composer create-project laravel/laravel your-project-name
* need github credentials for rate limit
* install php5-mcrypt
* Ensure Apache vhost allows overrides from public/.htaccess to do routing
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data app/storage -R
$ echo "CREATE DATABASE yarr; GRANT ALL ON yarr.* TO 'yarr'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'me_hearties'" | mysql -u root -p
$ php artisan migrate
