YARR
====

Summary
-------

YARR is Yet Another RSS Reader. It was built during of Refresh Oxford Hackday 3, as an experiment in learning and using a new MVC-based PHP framework in one day.

The inspiration was Google's upcoming termination of the Google Reader for RSS feeds. The big question was: could we write a replacement, web-based, multi-user RSS reader, with three developers, in only one working day?

The somewhat smaller answer was: kind of.
